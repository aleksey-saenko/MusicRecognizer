## Privacy policy

As a client application, Audile respects your privacy and doesn't collect or analyze any personal data. The app doesn't use ads, tracking and analytics services. The app records audio from the microphone only during a short recognition session on your demand. Recorded data is used solely for recognition purposes and is stored in app private storage for deferred recognitions based on the selected fallback policy.

The app does use third-party services that may collect your personal information. When using these remote services, you agree to the terms of use of these services:

* [AudD](https://audd.io/) ([Terms of Service](https://audd.io/terms/), [Privacy Policy](https://audd.io/privacy/))

* [ACRCloud](https://www.acrcloud.com/) ([Terms of Service](https://www.acrcloud.com/terms/), [Privacy Policy](https://www.acrcloud.com/privacy/))

* [Odesli](https://odesli.co/) ([Terms of Service](https://odesli.co/terms), [Privacy Policy](https://odesli.co/privacy))

Osesli remote service is used after each successful recognition to obtain additional platform-specific track links.

For recognition purpose, Audile uses either AudD or ACRCloud remote services at the user's choice. When using these services, short audio recordings (3-10 seconds) are sent directly to the remote service. No other sensitive information is shared. As Audile is intended to be an open-source application, it doesn't use closed-source audio fingerprinting libraries.

Audile uses [ACRA](https://github.com/ACRA/acra) to generate crash reports in case of application failures. These reports contain detailed device and crash information, which can be useful for fixing issues. Reports are not sent automatically; instead, the app provides an option to email the report to developers, granting users full control over sharing their information.
